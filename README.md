## Wrapper for pkmn/engine

This is a header-only library to make the usage of [pkmn-engine](https://github.com/pkmn/engine) more accessible and intuitive.

A minimal working example on how to integrate engine-wrapper into a CMake project and how to use it can be found in the CMake file and main.cpp.

Examples for set, team and battle creation can be found in include/src/gen1/samples.
